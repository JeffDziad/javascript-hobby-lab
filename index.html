                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>Ever since the Shuttle program, I have been infatuated with the idea of exploring the vastness of space. In these seemingly futuristic times
                , it is more important than ever to understand why we should explore space. In these past few years, we've made amazing strides in our development
                of new rockets to send spacecraft and humans to space. One of the major leaders being SpaceX, who have managed to successfully land reusable rockets
                back on land multiple times.</p>

        <p> When launching a Falcon Heavy payload to space, three boosters need a place to land. SpaceX has developed a system so precise, it can land multiple
        boosters within a couple hundred meters of each other.</p>
